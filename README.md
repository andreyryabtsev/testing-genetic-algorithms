Two separate tests of genetic algorithms. The summary of such algorithms is that a randomly
generated list of solutions gets evaluated on some independent criteria. The solutions with the
highest score (known as "fitness score") are selected to be randomly mutated and "bred together" -
parts of each solution are taken to form a new solution. The resulting set of modified solutions is
the foundation of the next set. Over time, good (or even correct) solutions can be found.
